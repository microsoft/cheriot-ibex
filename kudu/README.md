## Introduction
cheriot-kudu is 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller currently under development at Microsoft. Feature highlights include
 - 5 stage pipeline
 - in-order, dual-issue 
 - RV32IMC 
 - CHERIoT extension (same as cheriot-ibex)
 - Backward compatibility mode (same as cheriot-ibex)

See the following block diagram for an overview of cheriot-kudu hardwared design.

## Build the design for simulation and emulation
- For VCS simulation, wee the filelist (sim/run/kudu.vcs.f) and testbench files in sim/ directory.

In addition, [cheriot-safe](https://github.com/microsoft/cheriot-safe) provides an open-source FPGA platform for emulation and prototyping, which is on the branch "kudu".
